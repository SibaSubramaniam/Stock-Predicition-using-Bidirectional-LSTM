# Stock-Predicition-using-Bidirectional-LSTM
The goal of this model is to apply Bidirectional LSTM for stock market prediction. 

Input to the system is the prices of a particular stock for last 'n' days and output are 3 labels: (-1, 0, 1) where -1 denotes a drop in stock price, 0 denotes no change, and 1 denotes an increase in stock price for the next day.
